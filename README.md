I have worked on various <strong><i>AWS Services</i></strong> which ranges from <strong>VPC Architecting</strong> to <strong>AWS Glue Job</strong>. Some of the other services that I worked on include <strong><i>Session Manager, Instance Scheduler, Event Bridge, ECS Cluster,RDS DB, e.t.c.</i></strong>  <br>  
I have also used <strong>Terraform templates</strong> to automate the launch of some of these Services. Along with these I also have experience working on <strong>DevOps projects</strong> in which I have created <strong><i>AWS Lambda functions, CI/CD Pipelines, Deployed websites with SSL certificates, Created REST API‚Äôs.</i></strong> I also have good grip on <strong> <i>Google Cloud Services, Flask Framework and Frontend website Development. </i> </strong>

- Created Instance Scheduler infrastructure to centralize the process to stop/start EC2 instances & RDS DB‚Äôs based on Business hours which are running in multiple accounts. This helped the client company to reduce AWS Bill on these services by over 30%. 
- Used Terraform template to give SSM Access to all the instances available in organisation by creating & attaching required roles & VPC Endpoints. And also changed the IAM policies to permit users access to EC2 based on EC2 Instance Tags  
- Automated the creation of  RDS DB tables by using data from S3 Buckets with the help of AWS Glue Job.
- Migrated Datagrok Application which is in ECS cluster and it‚Äôs Databases by recreating whole cluster with Terraform templates. 
- Created Terraform Templates for whole existing VPC Architecture.  
- Created Terragrunt files & folder structure to automate the launch of VPC‚Äôs in all required regions whenever a new Account is created. 
- Created Backup and Restore policies for available Applications & flagged the Applications which are not following the Policy standards. 
- Created Systems Manager ‚ÄòRun Command Document‚Äô that will run scripts based on specific EC2 Instance events using Event Bridge. 
- Created Patch policies to automate the patching of security updates in EC2 instances. 
- Created an AWS Lambda function to backup & segregate S3 Bucket objects based on file extension. The function is triggered whenever an Object is uploaded into the main S3 Bucket and depending on different file extensions of the object the file is backed up into its respective S3 Bucket.
- Migrated a web application which was running in localhost into Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE). Created a Docker file to containerize the Flask Web application and moved the Docker Container image of it into Google Container Registry. And then launched a GKE cluster in google cloud. Then launched the image to run as a container in GKE.
- Created a complete AWS VPC architecture with different Public & Private Subnets and Launched Web Servers and Databases in it to create a 3 Tier Web Application.
- Launched multiple web servers and used Nginx server to balance the incoming traffic load.
- Installed SSL Certificate in all of the web servers to create a secure web access to my website.
- Created a complete Kubernetes architecture with one master node & two worker nodes in a private subnet. Launched multiple web applications as pods with different service names in it and used ingress-nginx to connect my internet facing Application Load Balancer to my private Kubernetes cluster. And then created an A Record in route 53 to attach my ALB with my Domain Name
- Created an Amazon API which would be used to perform CRUD operations on DynamoDB
- Created a Bill Receipt generating  REST API using Flask Framework.
- Helped a startup with frontend web development work of their website using HTML,CSS & JavaScript
- Created BitBucket CI/CD pipeline to be triggered whenever a commit is made into a staging repository to automatically deploy the changes into the staging environment.
